# Experimental design, ANOVA vs. Regression, Fixed vs. Random effect R Workshop. 

Hey there!  

This is a public GitHub repository to share the files needed for the **Kansas State University 2020 AGSA R Workshop - Experimental Design, ANOVA, and Regression**, taught by [@leombastos](https://github.com/leombastos).    

The workshop was divided into 2 days, 2 hours per day:  
- **day 1**: 
    - Intro to completly randomized design (CRD) and randomized complete block design (RCBD) 
    -  Differences between CRD and RCBD 
    - What happens if you run the wrong design ANOVA
    - Should you treat your blocks as fixed or random?    

- **day 2**:  
    - Difference between ANOVA and regression
    - Explore some cool applications of regression like 
        - prediction
        - finding an optimum input rate that maximizes yield
